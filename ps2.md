Problem Set 2 - Query Writing (continued)

Column Aliases

Often column names are obfuscated which make query's output difficult to understand. Column Aliases is a "nickname" (or alias) for a table's column(s) that gives a more user friendly (descriptive) name. To give a column an alias, use the AS keyword followed by the alias name. For example:

SELECT product_id AS itemcode FROM Products;
If the alias contains space, use quotes.

SELECT product_id AS `item code` FROM Products;
NOTE: The alias does not permenantly rename the column and is only temporary assignment.

SQL operators

Operators are reserved words used with the WHERE clause to perform an operation such as comparisons. The primary operators are:

Comparison operators (e.g., equality)
Logical operators (including negation)
Conjunctive operators
Arithmetic operators
Comparison operators

Comparison operators include equality, non-equality, less than, and greater than. The equal sign is used to test equality. For example,

SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE product_id=2000;
One way to select all product_id's not equal to 2000 is the following SELECT statement

SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE product_id<>2000;
Less than (and greater than)

And example using less than, (greater than is similar), which will return all product id's that cost less than $10:

SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE price<10;
Less than or equal

Combining the operators can give more specific results. For example, SELECT all product id's less than or equal to $10.

SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE price<=10;
Logical Operators

Logical operators include IS NULL, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, EXISTS, UNIQUE, ALL, SOME, and ANY. Logical operators are used (mostly) with the WHERE clause.

The following queries serve as examples for the LOGICAL operators.

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 and 20;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price IN(9.99, 19.99, 29.99);
The LIKE operator returns similar values using wildcards (underscore _ and percent %). The underscore represents one character where as the percent represents multiple characters.

The following returns all rows where the country starts with a letter 'C'.

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE country like 'C%';
The following returns all rows where the price ends in a 9.

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price like '%9';
The following returns rows where price has any value for the tens place and a 9 in the ones (pennies):

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price like '%._9';
Conjunctive operators (AND and OR)

Conjunctions are used to make more complex queries. For example suppose we want all products whose price is greater than 10 but less than 20. The following will return the desired results:

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price>10 AND price<20;
Two ways to write the query to return products with price less than or equal to $20:

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price<=20;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price<20 OR price=20;
Negation

Equality is negated using != or <>. All other statements can be negated using NOT operator.

Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) can be used to perform calculations on the results of columns. It is good to alias results of using arithmetic operators. For example,

SELECT 1.35*price AS `Sale Price` FROM Products;
Exercises

1.) Select all products (UPC) made in China whose price is less than $50.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE country='China' and price<50;
    
2.) Find products with "bird bath" in the description.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE description LIKE '%bird bath%';
    
3.) Find products whose cost is between $10 and $100.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100;
    
4.) Find products whose cost is less than or equal to $59.99.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE price<=59.99;

5.) Find products whose ID is between 5000 and 6000 or 7483, 4939, 3452, 9848, 11293, 12001.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE product_id BETWEEN 5000 AND 6000 OR product_id IN (7483, 4939, 3452, 9848, 11293, 12001);

6.) Find products that are not between 5000 and 6000 or 7483, 4939, 3452, 9848, 11293, 12001.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE product_id not BETWEEN 5000 and 6000 and (not product_id IN(7483, 4939, 3452, 9848, 11293, 12001);

7.) Find products whose country code is NULL.
    SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE country IS NULL;

8.) Calculuate the shipping volume and report it as 'Volume'.
    SELECT ship_depth*ship_width*ship_length AS ship_volume FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products;
    
9.) Suppose you want to have a 35% markup on all products and sales tax is 7.5%. Determine the 'Sales Price' of each product.
    SELECT ROUND(1.35*price+0.075*(1.35*price),2) AS sales_price FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products;
    
10.) True or False: Both conditions when using the OR operator must be true.
    FALSE
11.) What is the logical negation of the IN operator?
    NOT IN

12.) What is wrong with the folling statement: `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE price BETWEEN 10, 100;
   There needs to be an AND instead of a comma between the numbers of 10 and 100  
  
13.) Select products with length less than 12 inches and sort decsending.
  SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE length<12 ORDER BY length desc;

14.) How many products are there whose price is between $10 and $20?
  SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE cost BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

15.) How many products are there made in China whose MSRP is between $10 and $20.
  SELECT * FROM unemath_Hopkins.Products WHERE country='China' and MSRP BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
