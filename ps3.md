Problem Set 3

Define the terms: relation, tuple, attribute, record, and field.
What are keys in a relation?

What is a surrogate key and how is it used?

In the following equation, Area = Length x Width, identify the determinant(s).

If a relation has no duplicate data, how can you be sure there is always at least one primary key?

Give an example of a relation. Determine a natural key for this relation.

For question 7 - 8, Consider product orders. In particular, associated with an order is: customer name (first and last), address (street, city, state, zip), phone, email, the products orders (including item, quantity, and price).

Create a relational data model for orders. Consider applying normalization rules (discuss Monday)

For customer, could email be used as a primary key? If so, state why. Also, if possible to use as a primary key, discuss any disadvantages of using email as a primary key.
